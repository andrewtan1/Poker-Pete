# Poker-Pete

Poker Pete is an intelligent card-playing AI made to detect cards and play the optimal move in a specified card game using concepts of Digital Signal Processing, Machine Learning, and Game Theory.

## Requirements

### Necessary Software

- Python 3.7
- OpenCV 4.0.0.21
- OMAPL138 Libraries

### Necessary Hardware

- Texas Instruments LCDK
- USB Camera
- Green Table Mat
- Pack of 52 Playing Cards

## How to Use

Using the included python script(s) w/ the appropriate packages, we will generate the Neural Network constants for further development on the LCDK.

The Neural Network can now be implemented at the interrupt level using a more elaborate version of the method that was used in Mini-Project 2.
